# --- LLM & Transformer Ecosystem (Hugging Face) ---
transformers  # The core library for models like BERT, GPT, Llama
datasets      # For easily loading and processing datasets
accelerate    # Simplifies multi-GPU/TPU training and mixed precision
peft          # For Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (LoRA, QLoRA)
bitsandbytes  # For model quantization (running large models with less VRAM)
einops        # For flexible and powerful tensor operations
sentencepiece # Tokenizer used by many models like T5 and Llama
trl           # Transformer Reinforcement Learning (for DPO, PPO)

# --- Classical Machine Learning ---
scikit-learn  # Essential for metrics, data preprocessing, and traditional ML models

# --- Data Visualization ---
matplotlib
seaborn

# --- Utilities & Experiment Tracking ---
jupyterlab    # For interactive development in a notebook environment
tqdm          # For smart and informative progress bars
python-dotenv # Manages environment variables (e.g., API keys) from a .env file
wandb         # Weights & Biases for experiment logging and tracking
